1. You will need JDK 8 to build and run these exercises.

2. Recommended IDE is IntelliJ IDEA, but Eclipse Luna or later should also work.

  2.1. For IntelliJ IDEA users, all you should need to do is open the
  xj-conc-j8.ipr file.  You might also have to set up your JDK 1.8 within IDEA.
    2.1.1. There were issues on some IntelliJ versions with the Kotlin
    plugin causing compiler errors.  The simple workaround is to disable Kotlin.

  2.2. For Eclipse Luna users, please do the following:
    2.2.1. Open Eclipse
    2.2.2. Go to "File->Import..."
    2.2.3. Select "General->Existing Project into Workspace" and click "Next"
    2.2.4. "Select root directory" should point to this directory
    2.2.5. Click "Finish"
    Disclaimer: Some of our students experienced issues with a Scala plugin on
    Eclipse Luna, which caused compiler errors with our ThreadPoolSupplierTest
    Try update to at least Eclipse 4.2 instead
